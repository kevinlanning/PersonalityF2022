<h3>basics</h3>
<p>This is <strong>PPE 3003 Section 1</strong>. It is a 3-credit class
offered in the <strong>Fall 2021</strong> term. The class meets
<strong>MW 1230-2 in WB 105</strong>. There is no lab.</p>
<p>The professor is Kevin Lanning. My office hours are <strong>M
3-5</strong> (in person, WB 105) and <strong>F 1230-2</strong>
(virtually, via Zoom). You may schedule virtual appointments at <a
href="https://calendly.com/kevin-lanning/student-advising"
class="uri">https://calendly.com/kevin-lanning/student-advising</a>. My
office phone is (561) 594-1018, but it is quicker to reach me via email

<p><strong>course description:</strong> Psychology 3003H is an honors
survey of theory and research in the psychology of personality.</p>
<p><strong>course instructional method:</strong> In-person.</p>
<p><strong>course prerequisites / co-requisites</strong>: PSY 1012 is a
prerequisite.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives-student-learning-outcomes"
class="section level3">
<h3>course objectives / student learning outcomes</h3>
<p>In the seminar, the primary goal is to introduce students to the
field of personality theory and research. Personality is one of the core
sub-disciplines within psychology; it is distinct from other areas in
psychology in its simultaneous emphasis on (a) broad theories of human
nature, (b) research on the most important ways in which people differ,
and finally, (c) its recognition of the central idea that each of us is
unique. <strong>The study of personality is a central part of both the
psychology concentration and, more broadly, a liberal arts
education</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>note of honors distinction:</strong> The course receives
honors credit by virtue of its small class size, by virtue of a
dialectic approach in the classroom structure, and by the fact that
students receive extensive exposure to supplementary materials and
primary sources. This course differs substantially from a non-Honors
course in that (a) the expectations for participation in class
discussions will be greater than in a typical undergraduate course with
a larger number of students, (b) class projects will be undertaken in
heterogeneous groups in which students will be teaching and learning
from their peers as well as the instructor, (c) students receive
extensive exposure to primary research articles.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-assessments-assignments-grading-policy"
class="section level3">
<h3>course assessments, assignments, &amp; grading policy</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on a 100 point scale, with points earned by
participation, small assignments/quizzes, two exams, and, optionally,
extra credit.</p>
<p><strong>participation</strong> (10 points). Attendance is a necessary
but not sufficient part of class participation. Your participation grade
will be based also on the extent to which you contribute to our class by
asking constructive questions and helping your classmates solve the
numerous challenges which we will collectively face. That is, you can
earn participation points by showing up, learning, engaging, and helping
your classmates (particularly in small breakout groups).</p>
<p><strong>small assignments and online quizzes</strong> (30 points) You
can earn up to 25 points by (a) writing a simple autobiography and
reviewing the autobiographies of three of your classmates (10 points)
<strong>and</strong> (b) successfully completing any
<strong>fifteen</strong> of the “inquizitive” chapter quizzes (15
points). Note that, for credit, these quizzes need to be completed on or
before the date the chapter is discussed in class. Please see the <a
href="https://canvas.fau.edu/courses/90938/assignments">assignments</a>
page if you have questions.</p>
<p><em>As an alternative to the inquizitive quizzes, students may earn
up to 15 points by watching and reporting on additional Up Series videos
(at the rate of 5 points for each 3 videos) and/or submitting 3-page
reports on the unassigned chapters of the Funder text (Chapters 5, 13,
and 16-18).</em></p>
<p><strong>midterm exam</strong> (25 points). The midterm is likely to
include multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions. The essay
questions will be a (small) subset of a (large) number of questions that
will be presented to you in the week before the exam. The exam will
cover both readings and lecture/discussion materials.</p>
<p><strong>final exam</strong> (35 points). The structure of the final
exam will be similar to that of the midterm. Exams are likely to include
multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions. Exams will cover
both readings and lecture/discussion materials. The final exam will be
at least nominally cumulative, and will include a biographical essay
about a (particular) “healthy” or “optimal” personality.</p>
<p><strong>extra credit</strong> (up to 5 points). You may earn extra
credit by watching any three episodes of the <em>Up Series</em> and
contributing to a discussion of the film and its participants during the
last week of class. Students choosing this option must let me know in
writing no later than October 27.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>language about free speech, objectivity, academic freedom, and
interpersonal trust (added in response to Florida HB7)</h3>
<p><strong>language recommended by the FAU Provost’s office</strong>
“One of the objectives of this course is to facilitate critical thinking
and debate around topics, theories, and concepts where disagreement is
not only anticipated, but encouraged. The ability to think critically,
express your ideas clearly, and respond to the professor and other
students civilly are the keystones of the academic experience. In this
course, the professor will provide instruction in an objective manner
and will remain open to a wide variety of viewpoints, so long as those
viewpoints are evidence-based and presented in a respectful way. During
class, the professor may take positions and make statements for the sole
purpose of accomplishing an academic objective or enhancing the learning
environment. Additionally, the adoption of class materials for this
course does not imply an endorsement of the full content of those
materials or the positions of the authors of those materials. Often the
professor will provide materials as a point of departure for critical
thinking and debate. Students should keep in mind that the ideas
presented or discussed during class may not necessarily reflect the
professor’s personal beliefs or opinions on the subject matter.”</p>
<p><strong>language recommended by the United Faculty of
Florida</strong> “Students are encouraged to employ critical thinking
and to rely on data and verifiable sources to interrogate all assigned
readings and subject matter in this course as a way of determining
whether they agree with their classmates and/or their instructor. No
lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a
particular feeling, perception, viewpoint or belief.”</p>
<p><strong>a personal comment</strong> It is critical that the
interpersonal trust and appreciation for human dignity that characterize
the campus community and frame our classroom discourse remain
intact.</p>

<div id="additional-selected-university-college-policies"
class="section level3">
<h3>additional selected university &amp; college policies</h3>
<p><strong>incomplete grade policy:</strong> University policy states
that a student who is passing a course, but has not completed all work
due to exceptional circumstances, may, with consent of the instructor,
temporarily receive a grade of incomplete (“I”). The assignment of the
“I” grade is at the discretion of the instructor, but is allowed only if
the student is passing the course.</p>
<p><strong>attendance policy:</strong> Students are expected to attend
all of their scheduled University classes and to satisfy all academic
objectives as outlined by the instructor. The effect of absences upon
grades is determined by the instructor, and the University reserves the
right to deal at any time with individual cases of non-attendance.
Students are responsible for arranging to make up work missed because of
legitimate class absence, such as illness, family emergencies, military
obligation, court-imposed legal obligations or participation in
University-approved activities. Examples of University-approved reasons
for absences include participating on an athletic or scholastic team,
musical and theatrical performances and debate activities. It is the
student’s responsibility to give the instructor notice prior to any
anticipated absences and within a reasonable amount of time after an
unanticipated absence, ordinarily by the next scheduled class meeting.
Instructors must allow each student who is absent for a
University-approved reason the opportunity to make up work missed
without any reduction in the student’s final course grade as a direct
result of such absence.</p>
<p><strong>time commitment per credit hour:</strong> This course has
three (3) credit hours. For traditionally delivered courses, not less
than one (1) hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction each week
is expected for fifteen (15) weeks per Fall or Spring semester, and a
minimum of two (2) hours of out-of-class student work for each credit
hour. Equivalent time and effort is required for Summer Semesters, which
usually have a shortened timeframe. Fully online courses, hybrid,
shortened, intensive format courses, and other non-traditional modes of
delivery will demonstrate equivalent time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>classroom etiquette/disruptive behavior policy
statement:</strong> Disruptive behavior is defined in the FAU Student
Code of Conduct as “… activities which interfere with the educational
mission within classroom.” Students who disrupt the educational
experiences of other students and/or the instructor’s course objectives
in a face-to-face or online course are subject to disciplinary action.
Such behavior impedes students’ ability to learn or an instructor’s
ability to teach. Disruptive behavior may include, but is not limited to
non-approved use of electronic devices (including cellular telephones);
cursing or shouting at others in such a way as to be disruptive; or,
other violations of an instructor’s expectations for classroom conduct.
For more information, please see the <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/studentconduct/">FAU Office of Student
Conduct</a>.</p>
<p><strong>code of academic integrity policy statement:</strong>
Students at Florida Atlantic University should endeavor to maintain the
highest ethical standards. Academic dishonesty is a serious breach of
these ethical standards, because it interferes with the University
mission to provide a high quality education in which no student enjoys
an unfair advantage over any other. Academic dishonesty is also
destructive to the university community, which is grounded in a system
of mutual trust and places high value on personal integrity and
individual responsibility. Harsh penalties are associated with academic
dishonesty. For more information, see <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/regulations/chapter4/4.001_Code_of_Academic_Integrity.pdf">University
Regulation 4.001</a> and the WHC code at <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/honors/academics/honor-code.php"
class="uri">http://www.fau.edu/honors/academics/honor-code.php</a>.</p>
<p><a
href="http://libguides.fau.edu/c.php?g=325629&amp;p=2352760"><strong>Plagiarism</strong></a>
is the deliberate use and appropriation of another’s work without
identifying the source and trying to pass off such work as one’s own.
Any student who fails to give full credit for ideas or materials taken
from another has plagiarized. This includes all discussion board posts,
journal entries, wikis, and other written and oral presentation
assignments. Plagiarism is unacceptable in the University community.
Academic work must be an original work of your own thought, research, or
self-expression. When students borrow ideas, wording, or organization
from another source, they must acknowledge that fact in an appropriate
manner. If in doubt, cite your source.</p>
<p><strong>disability (accessibility) policy statement:</strong> In
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act
(ADAAA), students who require reasonable accommodations due to a
disability to properly execute coursework must register with Student
Accessibility Services (SAS) and follow all SAS procedures. SAS has
offices across three of FAU’s campuses – Boca Raton, Davie and Jupiter –
however disability services are available for students on all campuses.
For more information, please visit the SAS website at <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/sas/">www.fau.edu/sas/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>grade appeal process:</strong> You may request a review of
the final course grade when you believe that one of the following
conditions apply: There was a computational or recording error in the
grading, the grading process used non-academic criteria, there was a
gross violation of the instructor’s own grading system. <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/regulations/chapter4/index.php">Chapter 4 of
the University Regulations</a> contains information on the grade appeals
process.</p>
<p><strong>religious accommodation policy statement:</strong> In
accordance with rules of the Florida Board of Education and Florida law,
students have the right to reasonable accommodations from the University
in order to observe religious practices and beliefs with regard to
admissions, registration, class attendance, and the scheduling of
examinations and work assignments. For further information, please see
<a
href="http://www.fau.edu/academic/registrar/FAUcatalog/academics.php">Academic
Policies and Regulations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>university approved absence policy statement:</strong> In
accordance with rules of the Florida Atlantic University, students have
the right to reasonable accommodations to participate in University
approved activities, including athletic or scholastics teams, musical
and theatrical performances and debate activities. It is your
responsibility to notify the instructor at least one week prior to
missing any course assignment.</p>
<p><strong>drops/withdrawals:</strong> You are responsible for
completing the process of dropping or withdrawing from a course. Please
click on the following link for more information on dropping and/or
withdrawing from a course. Please consult the <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/registrar/registration/faqs.php">FAU Registrar
Office</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>counseling and psychological services (CAPS) center:</strong>
Life as a university student can be challenging physically, mentally and
emotionally. Students who find stress negatively affecting their ability
to achieve academic or personal goals may wish to consider utilizing
FAU’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Center. CAPS provides
FAU students a range of services – individual counseling, support
meetings, and psychiatric services, to name a few – offered to help
improve and maintain emotional well-being. For more information, go to
